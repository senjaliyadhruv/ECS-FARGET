# 🚀 ECS Fargate Deployment using Terraform

This project automates the deployment of a containerized application on **AWS ECS Fargate** using **Terraform**.  
It provisions a highly available and scalable setup with Application Load Balancer, Security Groups, IAM Roles, and ECS Fargate.

---

## ✅ Features

- AWS ECS Fargate Cluster provisioning
- ECS Task Definition with Docker image
- Application Load Balancer + Target Group
- Auto-created VPC + Public Subnets
- IAM roles for ECS Task Execution
- Security Groups for ALB and ECS
- Terraform modules for clean structure (optional)
  
---

## 📦 Use Case

This setup is ideal for:

- Running containerized applications without managing EC2
- Lightweight apps that need scalability and low ops overhead
- Quick, production-grade deployments with Load Balancer, security, and IAM
